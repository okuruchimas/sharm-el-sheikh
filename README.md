# Go-Go Portal for Sharm El Sheikh

This repository contains the source code for a multilingual portal built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and TypeScript. It presents events, locations and services in Sharm El Sheikh, integrates Google Maps and exposes data via a GraphQL API.

## Key Features

- **Next.js** with both SSG and SSR modes
- **React UI** styled with Emotion/MUI
- **Internationalization** via `next-i18next` (en, uk, ar-EG, de, it)
- **GraphQL** queries to a Strapi backend with type generation (`npm run generate`)
- **Google Maps** integration for displaying locations
- **Email sending** through the serverless route `pages/api/send-email.ts`
- **Automatic sitemap** generation after building (`next-sitemap`)

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a `.env.local` file and provide the required environment variables (see below).
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Building the project

```bash
npm run build    # compile
npm start        # run the built version
```

To update GraphQL types use:
```bash
npm run generate
```

## Required Environment Variables

## Directory Overview

- **pages/** – Next.js pages and API routes
- **components/** – reusable React components and sections
- **graphql/** – GraphQL queries and fragments
- **gql/** – types generated by `graphql-codegen`
- **public/locales/** – translation files for `next-i18next`
- **utils/** – helper functions (`fetchApi.ts`, `get-layout-data.ts`, etc.)
- **constants/** – shared constants and enums

## Linting

## Deployment

The production build can be deployed to any platform that supports Node.js. After running `npm run build`, both static and server parts of the project are generated. A sitemap is produced for SEO using `next-sitemap`.
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
